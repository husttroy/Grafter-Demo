\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
Up to a quarter of software systems consist of code clones from somewhere else. However, the cost of developing test cases is high, which makes test reuse among similar code attractive. This paper introduces {\grafter}, the first test transplantation and reuse approach for enabling runtime behavior comparison between clones. To handle the use of different types, methods, and variables in clones, {\grafter} automatically inserts stub code to propagate data between corresponding variables while ensuring type safety. {\grafter}'s code transplantation succeeds in 94\% of the cases, and its fine-grained differential testing can detect more seeded faults than a baseline static cloning bug finder. This result shows {\grafter}'s potential to assist developers in catching subtle bugs during copy and paste and to aid developers in comprehending the runtime behavior of nonidentical clones.
